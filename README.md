# ardener-wifi

Can flash new firmware, set default wifi settings (so that arduino does not have to) and run primitive serial console (for some reason, screen does not work well, but any API do). SerialIO module is slighly overengineered (was practicing Monad transformers), but might be useful in future for creating scripts for other devices.
